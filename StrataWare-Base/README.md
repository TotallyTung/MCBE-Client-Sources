Strata Client Development Release

Version: 1.21.2.2

Overview:

This release is built upon the framework of Lexical 1.21.2.2, specifically leveraging Zero's "BoostV2" leak as a starting point. However, this version has undergone significant modifications, with roughly 90% of the modules being entirely rebuilt from the ground up. The goal was to create a more stable, customizable foundation for development, though it is important to note that it is a base client and not the final product.

This client version includes many fixes for prior crashes, enhancing overall performance. However, please keep in mind that the code remains unfinished and may not be the cleanest or most refined. While we've resolved many of the major issues, there is still room for improvement.

Important Notes:

This is a Base Client only â€” It does not include all modules that are found in the original build.

Modules Availability: Some of Strata's core modules are exclusive and will not be released unless a trade is negotiated.

Please be aware that you will not receive the full source code with this release. Instead, you will be granted access to the Software Development Kit (SDK) to help you build and modify the client further.

Credit and Usage:

If you choose to use this client as a foundation for your own development, we kindly request that you provide proper credit to the original contributors, namely:

Attribution helps maintain the integrity and acknowledgment of the development work involved.

Disclaimer:

This client is a work-in-progress, and while most crashes have been addressed, there is no guarantee of perfection.

You are encouraged to customize and enhance the client further, but please respect the crediting guidelines.
